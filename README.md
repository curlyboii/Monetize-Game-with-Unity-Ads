This is an example of how you can implement ads in games using Unity Ads

We start the project, and at the click of a button, we must view an ad that cannot be missed.

By pressing the button, we see that the project has started, and displayed the message "Show Rewarded Ads"

When we close ads, we get 70 coins.
