# Monetize-Game-with-Unity-Ads

This is an example of how you can implement ads in games using Unity Ads

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Project Description</h1>

<h3 style="font-size: 15px;"> We start the project, and at the click of a button, we must view an ad that cannot be missed.</h3>

By pressing the button, we see that the project has started, and displayed the message "Show Rewarded Ads"

When we close ads, we get 70 coins.
